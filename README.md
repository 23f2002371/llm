# LLM Agent Proof-of-Concept (POC): Browser-Based Multi-Tool Reasoning

This project is a **proof-of-concept browser-based LLM agent** that demonstrates how modern language models can extend beyond plain text responses. Instead of behaving like a simple chatbot, this agent can dynamically choose and execute tools such as **Google Search**, **AI Pipe workflows**, and **JavaScript code execution**, combining their results into an intelligent reasoning loop.

The goal is to provide a **minimal, hackable, single-page web app** where developers and learners can experiment with LLM-powered tool use.

## üöÄ Features

* **Reasoning Loop** ‚Äì The agent runs in a loop where it:

  1. Accepts user input.
  2. Queries the LLM for a response.
  3. Executes tool calls requested by the LLM.
  4. Continues until the task is complete.

* **Tool Integrations:**

  * üîç **Google Search API** ‚Äì Fetch snippet results for web queries.
  * üîó **AI Pipe Proxy API** ‚Äì Run flexible dataflows and pipelines.
  * ‚ö° **JS Code Execution** ‚Äì Safely execute JavaScript snippets inside the browser sandbox.

* **OpenAI-Style Tool Calling** ‚Äì All tools follow the same standardized schema used in OpenAI function calling.

* **Simple UI** ‚Äì Bootstrap-powered interface with:

  * Model picker (choose provider/model).
  * Conversation window.
  * Alerts for errors and warnings.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

The agent loop is inspired by Python pseudocode but fully implemented in **JavaScript** for browser use.

```python
def loop(llm):
    msg = [user_input()]
    while True:
        output, tool_calls = llm(msg, tools)
        print("Agent:", output)
        if tool_calls:
            msg += [handle_tool_call(tc) for tc in tool_calls]
        else:
            msg.append(user_input())
```

This loop ensures the LLM can reason step by step, triggering tools when necessary and asking the user for clarification when done.

## üì¶ Setup

1. Clone the repository and open `index.html` in a modern browser.
2. Configure API keys in the UI:

   * **LLM Provider API Key** (OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google).
   * **Google Search API Key + Engine ID** (for web search).
   * **AI Pipe endpoint key** (optional).
3. Start chatting with the agent!
